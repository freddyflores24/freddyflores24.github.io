## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

    Lab 1 Part 1

*This was my first favorite lab because it introduced us to VS code, Terminal and getting used to github. At first the READ.me was confusing but with some help from the professor I was soon a pro and completed the lab. I liked working on the hello world in part 1 because it slowly introduced c++ concepts and made it really easy to understand.

    Lab 7 Part 2

*This was my second favorite lab because we used do while loops to code. I found it really fun also being able to code with while loops as well, challenging at first but got the hang of it. I did find it a bit difficult as well as my partner to code with an if statement inside a loop. After some surfing on Learncpp.com i began to grasp the concept and it got easier

    Lab 8 Part 2

*This was my third favorite lab because I learned how to play a card game I have seen many others play, but had not had the time to learn. I was confused on using the shell commands but the TA did a good job helping me further understand this concept and completing the lab. I also was thrilled to validate command line arguments.
