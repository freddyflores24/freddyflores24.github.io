## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

    Lab 1 Part 1

*This was my first favorite lab because it introduced us to Visual Studio Code, Terminal and getting used to Github. At first the understanding part-1 was confusing but with some help from my professor I was starting to get the hang of using vs code alongside the terminal. I liked working on the hello world because it slowly introduced c++ concepts and made it really fun to learn.

    Lab 7 Part 2

*This was my second favorite lab because we used do while loops to code. I found it really fun also being able to code with while loops as well, challenging at first but with practice, it was easier. Although my partner and I found hardships to code with an if statement inside a loop, after some surfing on learncpp.com we began to grasp the concept a lot better.

    Lab 8 Part 2

*This was my third favorite lab because I learned how to play a card game I have seen many others play, but had not had the time to learn. I was confused on using the shell commands but the TA did a good job helping me further understand this concept and completing the lab. I was also thrilled to validate command line arguments. I had lots of fun being the navigator in this particular lab because my parter was very intrested and competent with playing blackjack.
